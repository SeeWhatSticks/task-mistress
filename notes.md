# To Dos
Commands that I will not be implementing, and why:
* !beg - Turn this into a button on an interface
* !begin - Need to rethink whether this is necessary and how rounds will work
* !interface - Try to automate setup, if possible
* !end - May have an interface for Admin
* !limits - Set all and unset all buttons provide an interface in PM.
* !list - Button in GUI.
* !set - All channel IDs can realistically be copy/pasted into a config file. In addition, beg intervals and treat intervals, and the like, are no longer included.
